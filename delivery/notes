# TODO
1. (X) Research mattermost v4 api, espcailly those about Diagnostics
2. (X) Test if older version api is opened
3. (X) Try to find some supporter's account or any account 
4. (X) Find if any HelpDesk open port to interacte 
5. (X) Try Websocket authentication challenge
6. Look into Helpdesk. Hope to find some account info
	- Open a ticket will give us ticket id and a <ticket_id>@delievry.htb email address. And it tells us if we want to add more information to the ticket just EMAIL TO that @delivery.htb email address
	- So we use this EMAIL TO feature to get the verification mail of our matttermost account
7. In the mattermost channel, root posted the credential which can use to login into osTicket and ssh to the server
